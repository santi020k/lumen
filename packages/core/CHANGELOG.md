# @santi020k/lumen-core

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [`b30a72a`](https://github.com/santi020k/lumen/commit/b30a72aec1742b0ce39214fbf299099011d1a510) - Add `AnimatedNumber` and `RevealGroup`, and extend `ScrollReveal` with shared duration, delay,
  threshold, and repeat controls across Astro, React, Elements, metadata, runtime behavior, and
  standalone styles. Overlay entrances now use the canonical Lumen motion tokens.
  Astro `ButtonLink` controls now share the same subtle CSS hover lift as `Button`, while directional
  arrow motion remains as a navigation cue.

- [`26053f4`](https://github.com/santi020k/lumen/commit/26053f437784f4f771a7af8ddee8426c5bfc8cc5) Thanks [@santi020k](https://github.com/santi020k)! - Add competitor-informed product primitives, AI discovery docs, shared behavior helpers, and registry
  installation tooling.

  The shared catalog now includes scheduling, advanced data collection, theme builder, rich text
  editor, and advanced form field surfaces. Astro, React, and Web Components expose matching class and
  data contracts, and the docs app includes examples for each new primitive.

  The core package now includes reusable schedule, data-view, and theme helpers for state
  serialization, persistence, virtual ranges, scheduling conflicts and resize math, server request
  adapters, and contrast-safe theme tuning. The umbrella package exposes a `lumen` CLI that can add
  recipes, merge conflicts deterministically, and load token-authenticated private registries.

- [`c417a07`](https://github.com/santi020k/lumen/commit/c417a0728fe0aebebcf3a8f3b636c03f89ef3654) - Expand rich text editors with value-bearing commands, keyboard shortcuts, active toolbar states,
  HTML and text change events, accessible editable props, and richer toolbar/content styling.

- [`d802296`](https://github.com/santi020k/lumen/commit/d80229694b15c0c23e8846ed68780fce5222f2dd) Thanks [@santi020k](https://github.com/santi020k)! - Add Figma-oriented theme token exports for variable automation and design-token import workflows.

- [`b6f7d70`](https://github.com/santi020k/lumen/commit/b6f7d7091f099e964371fd75844eb645e858e866) Thanks [@santi020k](https://github.com/santi020k)! - Add a Lucide-backed Icon primitive with shared full-catalog icon names across Astro, React, and Web Components. Credit the upstream Lucide and Feather creators and ship their license notices with the core package.

- [`255e9fd`](https://github.com/santi020k/lumen/commit/255e9fd43b1d367418d3b3112bc973f510143356) - Add sixteen components to close the gap with enterprise UI libraries (Ant Design, MUI, Mantine, Chakra, React Aria): Stepper, FileUpload, Tour, Anchor, Segmented, Toolbar, Descriptions, Popconfirm, Transfer, Cascader, TreeSelect, Mentions, QRCode, Watermark, Affix, and SpeedDial. Each ships as a thin, token-driven wrapper across Astro (reference), React, and Web Components, with shared CSS and progressive-enhancement runtime for the interactive primitives (FileUpload drag-and-drop, Anchor scroll-spy, Tour step navigation, Transfer list movement, Mentions autocomplete, Cascader and TreeSelect value selection). Toolbar reuses the existing roving-focus runtime and Popconfirm/Cascader/TreeSelect reuse the popover disclosure runtime.

- [`5aab08e`](https://github.com/santi020k/lumen/commit/5aab08e1e765444d16f5e41956dca486128e812f) Thanks [@santi020k](https://github.com/santi020k)! - Add shared ThemeBuilder controller helpers, React `useThemeBuilder`, and Web Components ThemeBuilder behavior for token previews and exports.

### Patch Changes

- [`bf6ea87`](https://github.com/santi020k/lumen/commit/bf6ea8786fdb307bf7b3fc2313e5a2850bfdf579) Thanks [@santi020k](https://github.com/santi020k)! - Add shared Astro prop helpers for class/className merging and glass alias resolution, and standardize Astro overlays on the glass prop while keeping surface="glass" as a deprecated compatibility alias.

- [`f5c36ab`](https://github.com/santi020k/lumen/commit/f5c36ab1b22daf6f532869c576be97fa22474a43) Thanks [@santi020k](https://github.com/santi020k)! - Improve dark theme readability for docs and primitives.

  Dark glass surfaces now use dark aliases instead of inheriting light glass fills, selected and status controls use higher-contrast foreground pairs, generated dark themes produce more readable muted text, and the ThemeBuilder runtime initializes independently from generic component bindings.

- [`1df25dc`](https://github.com/santi020k/lumen/commit/1df25dce01ef07b91a0e54c76abead493e7a5570) Thanks [@santi020k](https://github.com/santi020k)! - Add glass surface tokens, boolean glass props and attributes, and documentation for supported glass surfaces. Expand glass support across layout, data display, feedback, navigation, and editor-style container primitives with matching Astro, React, and Elements examples.

- [`5ae75c5`](https://github.com/santi020k/lumen/commit/5ae75c5f60b4fb4382bba9c0634bef8c0721fa96) Thanks [@santi020k](https://github.com/santi020k)! - Polish Code block layout so headers avoid control overlap, inline code uses the component palette, framed examples preserve multiline formatting without inheriting global pre borders, and the Astro/React Code components can render a normalized `code` string with lightweight theme-aware token colors.

- [`e5dcf54`](https://github.com/santi020k/lumen/commit/e5dcf54cb2635406a66ca65cfa53d99423d6235a) - Restore the cyan and teal Lumen Light palette across standalone CSS, exported core tokens, and the
  Figma theme contract.

- [`24990c5`](https://github.com/santi020k/lumen/commit/24990c52f458b4a157d22e197e520fc6eec72ce8) Thanks [@santi020k](https://github.com/santi020k)! - Include glass surface variables in generated ThemeBuilder tokens, CSS exports, scoped previews, Figma color variables, and design-token JSON.
