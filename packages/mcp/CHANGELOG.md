- [#25](https://github.com/santi020k/lumen/pull/25) [`2c480eb`](https://github.com/santi020k/lumen/commit/2c480eb61ff3e14d526fd1f528f9c0a7d1591684) Thanks [@santi020k](https://github.com/santi020k)! - Add canonical cross-platform design tokens, synchronized light and dark semantic palettes, and
  native foundation packages for React Native, SwiftUI, and Jetpack Compose. Ship the first shared
  native primitive slice with theme, text, icon, icon button, surface, button, text field, badge,
  divider, spinner, card, alert, progress, and avatar contracts while preserving each platform's
  native accessibility and interaction model. Adapt SwiftUI control density automatically for
  touch-first iOS and pointer-first macOS applications while keeping one shared component API. Add
  Apple-native settings, selection, empty state, row, banner, metric, section, and status primitives,
  plus macOS shortcut recording and SF Symbols selection based on recurring Lumen application needs.

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [`e5a6b36`](https://github.com/santi020k/lumen/commit/e5a6b366ed28a5513c375afb3f36ac26117b749f) Thanks [@santi020k](https://github.com/santi020k)! - Make `lumen doctor` workspace-aware, ignore generated build trees, parse real adapter imports,
  recognize controlled Astro toggles, and deduplicate diagnostics. Preserve native form-control
  `size` across adapters while adding explicit Astro `visualSize` and Elements `visual-size` styling
  contracts with pre-1.0 alias compatibility.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- [#13](https://github.com/santi020k/lumen/pull/13) [`da44247`](https://github.com/santi020k/lumen/commit/da44247c127a77744bdd84ace78b85a9ba586839) Thanks [@santi020k](https://github.com/santi020k)! - Release Lumen 1.0 with stable public component, token, styling, framework, registry, and MCP
  contracts. Remove the deprecated `surface="glass"` overlay alias and
  `ui:datatable-selection-change` event; use the `glass` prop or attribute and
  `ui:data-table-selection-change` instead.

### Minor Changes

- [#13](https://github.com/santi020k/lumen/pull/13) [`6e84499`](https://github.com/santi020k/lumen/commit/6e84499b05e1e3cda0087e686db88663de351c48) Thanks [@santi020k](https://github.com/santi020k)! - Add compound Card and Stat parts, stable styling contracts, wrapper-safe React composition,
  framework behavior metadata, chart formatting and presentation controls, sibling-derived registry
  recipes, and integration diagnostics with canonical setup generation.

- [#13](https://github.com/santi020k/lumen/pull/13) [`46c2aca`](https://github.com/santi020k/lumen/commit/46c2aca5bac0579f8265b77a4991a7c640903914) Thanks [@santi020k](https://github.com/santi020k)! - Add arbitrary-text CopyButton behavior, hydrated Progress updates, richer accessible Anchor

  CheckboxGroup, ListBox, Container, Stack, Grid, and VisuallyHidden components across Astro, React,
  and Elements.

  Ship an optional React Hook Form adapter package, Astro Actions error normalization, form-associated
  custom element behavior, accessible validation and error-summary focus, documented serialization,

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [#9](https://github.com/santi020k/lumen/pull/9) [`43197cc`](https://github.com/santi020k/lumen/commit/43197cc6d3c8fd831cb28f247b1212329ab67d79) Thanks [@santi020k](https://github.com/santi020k)! - Add a document-aware `ScrollProgress` primitive across Astro, React, and Web Components. Extend
  `Anchor` with heading depth metadata and add `neutral`, `brand`, and `outline` variants to `Pill`.

- [#9](https://github.com/santi020k/lumen/pull/9) [`43197cc`](https://github.com/santi020k/lumen/commit/43197cc6d3c8fd831cb28f247b1212329ab67d79) Thanks [@santi020k](https://github.com/santi020k)! - Add shared chart contracts, geometry helpers, visualization tokens, and accessible `Sparkline`,
  `BarChart`, `LineChart`, and `PieChart` components across Astro, React, and Web Components. The new
  pie renderer defaults to a donut, supports part-to-whole legends and center content, and includes
  a revealable semantic data table. Expand `Chart` with standard heading, description, value, and
  caption composition while preserving custom plot children.

### Patch Changes

- [#9](https://github.com/santi020k/lumen/pull/9) [`43197cc`](https://github.com/santi020k/lumen/commit/43197cc6d3c8fd831cb28f247b1212329ab67d79) Thanks [@santi020k](https://github.com/santi020k)! - Use the canonical Santi020k Montserrat family stack across Lumen interface text, including generated
  Watermark tiles, while keeping font loading and the `--ui-font` override under application control.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#7](https://github.com/santi020k/lumen/pull/7) [`325ad43`](https://github.com/santi020k/lumen/commit/325ad438380de27f4cba8eda6878a2aad7a2b33f) Thanks [@santi020k](https://github.com/santi020k)! - Add `CodeTabs` to the shared catalog with accessible, synchronized, copyable code examples across
  Astro, React, custom elements, and MCP discovery.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [`6129409`](https://github.com/santi020k/lumen/commit/61294095ee60bbafa0f8815b57ac815d52224c8e) Thanks [@santi020k](https://github.com/santi020k)! - Make MCP discovery framework-aware and release-verifiable. Component usage now includes authored
  React hook/controller examples, Astro runtime setup, custom-element registration, richer Elements
  examples, and corrected runtime event contracts. Natural-language search supports partial
  multi-component product queries, aliases, framework filtering, and normalized recipe names.

  Add `lumen_get_meta` and `lumen://meta` with deterministic catalog and package provenance, support
  Node.js 20.20+, keep the MCP versioned with framework releases, reject stale generated snapshots in
  CI, and smoke-test the packed package through a real external stdio connection.

  Add a catalog manifest and diff workflow, deterministic connection diagnostics, a self-hostable
  Streamable HTTP entrypoint, and release evaluations that benchmark natural-language search, exercise
  every framework contract over MCP, parse Astro and Elements examples, and type-check every generated
  React example against the package.

### Patch Changes

- [`81bf725`](https://github.com/santi020k/lumen/commit/81bf7256a1091b0e05cdbf919b5b42691ab861d8) Thanks [@santi020k](https://github.com/santi020k)! - Add wrapped block-code output across framework adapters, refine native accordion disclosure styling,
  and teach the registry and MCP catalog that Astro motion primitives require styles and
  `UIPrimitives`.

- [`485ef4b`](https://github.com/santi020k/lumen/commit/485ef4bc2d56969ba7292ff009c31877cbc3c627) Thanks [@santi020k](https://github.com/santi020k)! - Add a flush Accordion variant for compact FAQ and content-led disclosure lists.

- [`d7a8a84`](https://github.com/santi020k/lumen/commit/d7a8a8408c03c0c3005e7f0f515e815b59c51c17) Thanks [@santi020k](https://github.com/santi020k)! - Stabilize the existing catalog without adding components: complete the typed API reference, add
  cross-framework class and behavior contract checks, enforce coverage and bundle-size budgets, load
  motion controllers only when matching Astro primitives are present, and adopt
  `ui:data-table-selection-change` while keeping the previous DataTable event as a compatibility
  alias until Lumen 1.0.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [`a32b14d`](https://github.com/santi020k/lumen/commit/a32b14ddaac5cd8fcc939ae26008c84479e1ad0f) - Add `@santi020k/lumen-mcp`, a Model Context Protocol server that lets AI agents list components,
  read framework-aware usage and source, inspect recipes, search the catalog with ranked
  natural-language matches, and fetch Lumen tokens and agent rules over stdio. Ship validated
  structured tool outputs, browsable `lumen://` resources, a self-building local launcher, and a
  reproducible metadata snapshot generated from the registry, framework source, and documentation.

- [`4760e13`](https://github.com/santi020k/lumen/commit/4760e13631d7c5f84540eaf5013c22325481a2b7) - Preserve framework-native image optimization, lazy-load native images by default, and add opt-in
  dark-theme inversion for monochrome artwork.

### Patch Changes

- [`0b0c038`](https://github.com/santi020k/lumen/commit/0b0c03827675cbe9763a15e1e885a4648ea273e8) - Improve SpeedDial with rendered action icons, polished directional motion, an initial-open option,
  and complete click, dismissal, and keyboard menu behavior.
